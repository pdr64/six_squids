    <h3>Sensors</h3>
    <h4>Line Sensors</h4>
    <p>
      We decided to implement three line sensors. There are four possible scenarios given this configuration: when simply following a 
      straight line, we can either be perfectly on the line, in which case we simply continue going straight, or we can be veering left 
      or right slightly off the line, which is when the left or right sensor starts seeing white. To correct for this, we turn very slightly
      back in the direction towards the line. 
      <br>
      The fourth option is that we reach an intersection, in which case Gary launches a sequence of observations about his surroundings, 
      including wall detection and reporting information via radio about location and treasure detection. 
    </p>  
    <h4>Wall Sensors</h4>
    <p>
    We also decided to have three wall sensors. Initially we believed we should have a back wall sensor to detect if we started with a wall 
    behind us, but given the general configuration of the maze we determined this to be unecessary. At each intersection, Gary checks the front, 
    left and right wall sensors, by toggling a mux with the three analog inputs of the walls, and stores this information for both travel and 
    maze mapping purposes.
