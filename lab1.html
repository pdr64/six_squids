      <h2>Objective </h2>
    
      The goal of this lab was to familiarize ourselves with the Arduino Uno, the Arduino IDE, and the github repository. 
      To do this, we created programs that tested the functionality of our arduino using LEDs and Parallax servos.
      After testing our arduino, we assembled our robot and ran simple code on it to have it move autonomously.
      
      <h2>Material List</h2>
       <ul>
         <li>1 Arduino Uno</li>
         <li>1 USB A/B cable</li>
         <li>1 continuous rotation servo</li>
         <li>1 LED (yellow)</li>   
         <li>1 potentiometer</li>
         <li>Several resistors 
           <ul>
             <li>330 Ohm</li>
             <li>10K Ohm</li>
           </ul>  
          <li>1 solderless breadboard</li>
         <li>1 chassis</li>
         <li>2 wheels</li>
         <li>assorted screws</li>
         <li>ball bearings</li>
       </ul>
      <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <h3>Blinking LEDs</h3>
    To begin the lab, we opened up the blink sketch and examined it to understand how it works. 
    We successfully blinked the internal LED with the following code:
    <pre><code>
        void setup() {
          pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);  //This initializes the LED_BUILTIN as an output
        }

        void loop() {
          digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);  //Turns the LED on 
          delay(1000);  //Leaves the LED on for one second            
          digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);  //Turns the LED off
          delay(1000);  //Leaves the LED off for one second                   
        }

     </pre></code>
