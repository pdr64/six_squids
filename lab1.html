      <h2>Objective </h2>
      The goal of this lab was to familiarize ourselves with the Arduino Uno, the Arduino IDE, and the github repository. 
      To do this, we created programs that tested the functionality of our arduino using LEDs and Parallax servos.
      After testing our arduino, we assembled our robot and ran simple code on it to have it move autonomously.
