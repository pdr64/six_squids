  <center><h2>Objective </h2></center>
  <p>The goal of this lab was to start testing different signal processing, both audio and optical. The audio team worked on processing
     certain frequencies and ignoring background noise like talking and music whereas the optical team worked on detecting other robots' IR emitters and 
     ignoring the decoy frequencies.

  <center><h2>Procedure</h2></center>
  <br>
  <p><b>Note:</b> For both of our implementations, we had little chance making our amplifier circuits to work. We therefore resorted to <a target ="_blank" href="https://cei-lab.github.io/ECE3400-2017-teamAlpha/lab2.html">Team Alpha's approach</a>.
  </p>
  <h3>Optical Team - Detecting IR Hats</h3>
  <p>
    First, the optical team attempted to detect IR emitters on "hats" given to us by the TAs. The emit IR light at 6kHz, which is not 
    visible to humans but can be read by our IR sensor (OP598). The IR sensor was hooked up as seen below.</p>
  <br>

  <p>We used the Arduino library Open Music Labsâ€™ FFT to analyze all the input 
    from the sensor, and tried to detect a peak at the desired frequency. First we made sure we could see the peak on the oscilliscope,
    as seen below.</p>
  <br>
  <center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XtczPIGM19o" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

  <p>
    Next we implemented an amplifying circuit based on Team Alpha's solution from last year as recommended by the TAs after we could 
    not get our personally designed op-amp circuit working.We used a similar circuit to the one below except we used a photo transistor in place of the microphone and did not used the capacitor on the
    right.</p>   
  <center><img src="team_alpha_amp.png" class="img-rounded" alt="Amplifier Circuit" width="600" height="300"><p><b>Fig.2:</b> Image taken from Team Alpha's Website</p></center>
  <br>
  <p>
   After this we returned to the FFT library, where we were successfully able to identify the 6kHz bucket in the 42nd group, 
   which the decoy hat had no affect on due to the spacing of the buckets. Below you can see our FFT analysis, where the 42nd bucket is clearly high in the presense of the hat and low without it.

  <p>
    Therefore, the visual task was complete. See below for a video of Gary responding to the robot hat and not to the decoy!

  <h3>Acoutic Team - Detecting 660Hz Sound Frequency</h3>
  <p>We began with the circuit provided for the lab (see <i>fig. 4</i>) but realised that we needed to amplify our waveforms because they had been attenuated(see <i>fig. 5</i>).
    We began the task independently trying to build a circuit to detect our 660Hz sound wave. We worked hard switching between numerous designs of
    band-pass filters to amplifiers but nothing seemed to work for us. We decided to resort to Team Alpha's approach. We used the circuit from <i>fig. 2</i> above. 
    with slightly different values for the components. Our results, however, were very similar to Team Alpha's.

  <br>
  <p>Initially, we were using the free running mode of the example fft arduino code (fft_adc_serial.ino), where our desired frequency was identified in bin #5.</p>
  <center><img src="lab2_simple.PNG" class="img-rounded" alt="graph 1" width="600" height="300"><br><p><b>Fig. 5:</b>Image of FFT of signal. 660Hz frequency is located in bin 5.</p></center>
  <br>
  <p>After adding the amplification, this was what we observed.</p>

  <br>
  <p>We used the oscilloscope to varify that the circuit was really working and the video below shows that when the 660Hz signal was played, the marked signal rises.</p>
  <center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yiNgYGF8eoM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
  <p>
    We therefore made some specification to our code to sense when the wave in bin #5 was the highest.
    This was how we could tell when an incoming frequency was 660Hz. The video below shows a test performed on the detection of 660Hz.

  <br>
  <h3> Merging the Two Functionalities</h3>
  <p>We combined the two functions. To implement them together, we modified our arduino code. Inside the loop, we alternated between the two functions we created.
    This allowed both sound and IR sensing to work together. Below is a snippet of our code with the modifications.
  </p>
  <center><code><pre>
    void loop() {
     while(1) { // reduces jitter
      fft_audio ();
      fft_visual();    
     }
    }

    void fft_audio() {
     ...//code here
    }

    void fft_visual() {
    ... //code here
    }
  </pre></code></center>
  <p>
    The video below is the demonstration of the two functions working together. The green light is for sound and the red light is for IR sensing.
