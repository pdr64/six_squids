      The goal of this lab was to get our robot moving autonomously! First we used a basic line sensor on a grid consisting of white tape
      on a black background, finding the values the line sensor reported back and using them to recognize the difference between the lines and 
      the surface. We used this information to have our robot follow a line, ensuring that the middle sensor saw white and the outer two saw black,
      otherwise adjusting accordingly. Once we had this down, we made our robot follow a figure 8 by implementing a state machine, having the robot 
      turn left or right at junctions depending on its state along the path. Gary did a great job; see below!
