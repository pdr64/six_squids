    <center><h2>Objective </h2></center>
    
    <p>
      The goal of this milestone was to give Gary the ability to follow a set of arbitrary walls through right-hand wall following. While doing this, we needed to ensure
      that Gary could detect the presence of other robots as well, so we used our IR detection materials from Lab 2. We added IR sensors on Gary's sides that
      detect the proximity of the walls. With some code, we could tell Gary to check at every intersection whether or not there was a wall in front of him that he needed to avoid. 
      With all of this put together, we enabled Gary to circle a wall while following a line and stop when in close proximity to another robot!
    </p>

    <br>
    <center><h2>Figuring out IR Wall Sensors</h2></center>
    <p>
      Using long range IR sensors, we were able to avoid walls. To start, we simply hooked up the analog input of the wall sensor
      to the Arduino to find a reasonable threshold value at which point we would determine there was in fact a wall in front of Gary. 
      Next, we integrated the wall sensors onto our robot, temporarily zip tying them to both sides of the robot and to the front at 
      a height appropriate for the walls.

    <center><h2>Implementing Wall Following</h2></center>
    <p>
      In order to implement right-hand wall folliwng, we first attached three IR sensors to our robot on the front and both sides.

      <br>
      <br>
      Though we only needed two sensors for the sake of this Milestone, we will need 3 for our next lab so we added the last one anyway.
      Based on the return value of the right-side IR sensor, we could determine whether a wall was present or not. Gary could then follow a line
      until there was no wall detected on his right side, which means it is time to turn right. The process repeats indefinitely.
   
      Below is the code that shows how we did this. Basically, at every intersection there was a wall check to see if we should turn</p>
    <br>
    <code><pre>
    else if(center<thresh && right<thresh && left<thresh){ //checks if we are at an intersection
    if(frontw()) //checks if there is a wall in front of the robot
    { 
      digitalWrite(wall, HIGH); //toggles indicating LED
      if(rightw() && !leftw()) //checks which way we should turn
      {
        turn_left();
        Serial.println("turning left");
      }
      else if (leftw() && !rightw())
      {
        turn_right();
        Serial.println("turning right");
      }
      else if(leftw() && rightw())
      {
        turn_around();
        Serial.println("turning around");
      }
      else
      {
        turn_left();
        Serial.println("only front wall");
      }
      digitalWrite(wall, LOW);
    } 
  }
    </code></pre>

    <p>
      We already had line following and IR sensing implemented from previous labs, so all we had to do was schedule the 3 processes. 
      Essentially, we would follow lines until we reached an intersection, when we would check for walls. IR sensing was scheduled along 
      with line following.
      In this video you can see Gary following lines, avoiding walls, and sensing other robots! </p>
