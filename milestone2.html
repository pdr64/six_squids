    <center><h2>Objective </h2></center>
    
    <p>
      The goal of this milestone was to give Gary the ability to follow a set of arbitrary walls through right-hand wall following. While doing this, we needed to ensure
      that Gary could detect the presence of other robots as well, so we used our IR detection materials from Lab 2. We added IR sensors on Gary's sides that
      detect the proximity of the walls. With some code, we could tell Gary to check at every intersection whether or not there was a wall in front of him that he needed to avoid. 
      With all of this put together, we enabled Gary to circle a wall while following a line and stop when in close proximity to another robot!
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center><h2>Figuring out IR Wall Sensors</h2></center>
    <p>
      Using long range IR sensors, we were able to avoid walls. To start, we simply hooked up the analog input of the wall sensor
      to the Arduino to find a reasonable threshold value at which point we would determine there was in fact a wall in front of Gary. 
      Next, we integrated the wall sensors onto our robot, temporarily zip tying them to both sides of the robot and to the front at 
      a height appropriate for the walls.

    <center><h2>Implementing Wall Following</h2></center>
    <p>
      In order to implement right-hand wall folliwng, we first attached three IR sensors to our robot on the front and both sides.

      <br>
      <br>
      Though we only needed two sensors for the sake of this Milestone, we will need 3 for our next lab so we added the last one anyway.
      Based on the return value of the right-side IR sensor, we could determine whether a wall was present or not. Gary could then follow a line
      until there was no wall detected on his right side, which means it is time to turn right. The process repeats indefinitely.
   
      Below is the code that shows how we did this.</p>
    <br>
    <code><pre>
      int thresh=150;  //sets our threshold
      // correct for veer right
      while(analogRead(centSen)&gt;thresh && analogRead(rightSen)&gt;thresh && analogRead(leftSen)&lt;thresh){
        parallax1.write(94);
        parallax2.write(75);     
      }
      //correct for veer left
      while(analogRead(centSen)&gt;thresh && analogRead(rightSen)&lt;thresh && analogRead(leftSen)&gt;thresh){
        parallax1.write(115);
        parallax2.write(94);
      }
      // go straight
      while(analogRead(centSen)&lt;thresh && analogRead(leftSen)&gt;thresh && analogRead(rightSen)&gt;thresh){
        parallax1.write(100);
        parallax2.write(90);
      }  
    </code></pre>

    <center><h2> "Figure 8" Maneuvering</h2></center>
    <p>
      We implemented a finite state machine to do this, where each state is the current leg of the figure 8 that our robot is in.
      We then simply set up for each leg whether the next turn will be left or right upon reaching an intersection. 
      The relevant code is shown below!
    </p>
    <code><pre>
     follow_line();
     if(state==1 || state == 6 || state==7 || state==8){
        turn_left();
        if(state==8){
          state=1;
          } else{
            state++;
          }
     } else if (state==2 || state ==3 || state==4 || state==5){
        turn_right();
        state++;
    </pre></code>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>As you can see from the code, we simply needed two 'if' statements, wherein we assign a left or right turn following the current state.
      The current state increments after each turn so this process can continue. At the end, state 8 (the last leg of the figure 8) will move on to state
      1 to restart the process indefinitely. 
      Below is a ~crazy~ video of our robot, Gary, doing some "sick" figure 8s!
